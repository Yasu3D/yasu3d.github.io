        Hi.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm Leies Frisan, a self-taught game developer and 3d artist from Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
        <br>You may call me a "T-shaped" game dev. "A jack of all trades; master of one", if you will.
        <br>
        <br>
        My main passion is anything "3d-art". Environments, Characters, Props, Vehicles, whatever. If it can be represented with a lot of triangles it's my kinda thing.
        <br>I've been working with Blender since I was 13 and five years later here I am. Obsessed with these silly little triangles in my 'puter.
        <br>
        <br>
        Tech art would probably be my #2. Specifically shaders are fascinating; visualizing numbers with colors will never not amaze me. 
        <br>Programming in general is fascinating. I can tell computers what to do??? How dare people give me that kind of power.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other things I usually work with are Animation and Rigging, UI/UX Design and a bit of audio maybe.
      </p>

        If you feel like reading fine-print then this is just for you. The character you can see on the left is "Yasu", my character I appear as online. He's usually just an anthropomorphic cat, but I drew him with a tv head out of boredom once and it looks too cool to not use everywhere. My mug's on the right, by the way. Hello :v
      </p>

      <p class="img-subtitle">
        Oh hey you wanna read more, cool. My favorite console is the SNES (who would've guessed with that title font) and my favorite game is either Super Mario Kart or Stray.
      </p>

      <p class="img-subtitle">Alright that's enough, go read my studies or look at my art or something.</p>
