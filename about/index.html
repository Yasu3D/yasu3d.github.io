      <h3>About me.</h3>
      <p>I'm a self-taught 3D artist from Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
        <br>I got my hands on blender about five years ago to try and make custom scenery objects for NoLimits2. My first attempts were... <i>rough</i>, but ~4,000h later I'd consider myself <b>pretty damn good.</b>
        <br>Early on I joined a small dev team to make NoLimits2 maps and quickly took the role of lead 3d artist thanks to my attention to detail and overall model quality. I leared a good bit of game design theory as well, though I prefer modelling. I left the team in February 2021 due to abuse and extreme pressure/time demands with lacking or nonexistent compensation.</p>
      <p>Until mid-2022 I mostly did projects alone in my free time. Then I joined a separate group of people working on-and-off on a game to help out with modelling and texturing.
        <br>On the side I've also picked up character modelling and VRChat world creation. I've now made a handful of characters and published them as VRChat avatars for friends or commissioners.
        <br>So. Here I am now with plenty of experience under my belt.
      </p>

      <h3>What are my skills?</h3>
      <p>> I can do hardsurface- and poly-modelling.
        <br>> I can accurately model complex organic shapes with good topology.
        <br>> I can easily stick to a limit for poly-count (within reason).
        <br>> I can make clean and space-efficient UVMaps
        <br>> I can do simple rigging and skinning. (think VRChat-grade. not movie-grade.)
        <br>> I can make good-looking and detailed PBR textures.
        <br>> I can adapt to and stick with a project's artstyle. Be it toon or realism.
      </p>

      <h3>What do I struggle with?</h3>
      <p>> Sculpting. I haven't had the chance to properly learn it and much prefer hardsurface.
        <br>> Insufficient references. I'm a perfectionist and not knowing what something looks like exactly slows my modelling process down quite a bit.
        <br>> Artblock. I'm not the most creative person, but I can get the job done if I'm told what to make.
      </p>

      <h3>Other things I dabble in occasionally.</h3>
      <p>> Web developement (guess who made this website)
        <br>> Programming - I can write and read simple c# code, though my knowledge is still lacking in some regards.
        <br>> Music - both mixing and producing. I like hardtechno and jungle dnb a lot.
        <br>> 2D Art - I can draw... sort of. I'm definitely more confident with 3D. It helps for texturing though!
        <br>> Rhythm Games - they're cool.
