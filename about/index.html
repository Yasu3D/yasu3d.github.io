      <h3>About me.</h3>
      <p>I'm a (mostly) self-taught game dev and 3d artist from Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
        <br>I got my hands on blender about five(-ish) years ago to make custom scenery objects for NoLimits2. My first attempts were.. <i>rough</i>, but a few thousand hours later I'd consider myself <b>pretty damn good.</b>
        <br>On the way I learned texturing and picked up Substance Painter, which I've been using for about three-ish years [since ~mid 2020].
      </p>

      <h4>2020 - 2021 : CoasterGalaxyWorld.</h4>
      <p>Around early-mid 2020 I was approached by the owner of CoasterGalaxyWorld [abbrev. CGW] and joined their team. I started off at CGW with trackwork in NoLimits2. TL;DR - I designed virtual rollercoaster tracks that followed a vertex-controlled b-spline.</p>
      <p class="img-subtitle">> More info about NoLimits2 can be found <a href="https://www.nolimitscoaster.com/">here</a>.</p>

      <p>Alongside trackwork I learned more about 3d modelling and took on the role of lead technical 3d artist around early 2021.
        <br>In addition to that I learned general level design practices and how to texture models in Substance Painter, also becoming the lead texture artist.</p>
        <p>During my time at CGW I contributed to 7 of their projects and actively helped ship 3 (and a half) of them.</p>
      <p class="img-subtitle">> More about that in <a href="#projectsshipped">"projects I've helped ship"</a></p>
      <p>I left the team around mid-2021 with the intention to do freelance/hobby work because of repeated abuse and unrealistic time demands for no compensation.</p>

      <h4>2021 - 2023 : where I'm at now.</h4>
        <p>In August of 2021, I was approached by some members of CGW that had started their own side project. I can't say much about that project yet, but our team of six have all been working on it in our own time for fun and making slow but steady progress.
          <br>My role in development is mostly 3d modelling and texturing, though I occasionally write some simple code as well.
        </p>

        <p>On my own I did the occasional model as a study/for practice, some of which can be seen overe <a href="/3d_models">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Since 2020 I've also been working on VRChat avatars and steadily improved my character modelling skills.</p>

      <h3>What are my strengths?</h3>
      <p>> hardsurface- and poly-modelling.
        <br>> complex organic shapes with good topology.
        <br>> sticking to a limit for poly-count (within reason).
        <br>> clean and space-efficient UVMaps
        <br>> simple rigging and skinning.
        <br>> good-looking and detailed PBR textures.
        <br>> adapting to a project's artstyle, no matter if it's toon or realism.
      </p>

      <h3>Other things I dabble in occasionally:</h3>
      <p>> web developement - guess who made this website :^)
        <br>> programming - I can write c# decently well. Mostly used in Unity.
        <br>> music - both mixing and producing. I like hardtechno and jungle dnb a lot.
        <br>> 2D art - I'm definitely more confident with 3D, it helps for texturing though!
        <br>> rhythm games - they're cool.
