      <h3>Commission Info</h3>
      <p><b>I'm currently not open for commissions.</b></p>
      <p id="commissionsclosed">I offer commissions for:
        <br>> custom-made furry character models.
        <br>> simple assets (furniture, props, etc.)
      </p>
      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <h4>simple assets</h4>
      <p>> starting at 10€, anything goes. pricing for simple assets varies greatly depending on the request. contact me and I'll give you a quote.</p>
      <h4>characters</h4>
      <p>> starting at 200€. I may charge more for complex character designs or multiple outfits.</p>
      <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
      <h4>general</h4>
      <p>> commissioning me means you agree with my TOS and abide by them.
        <br>> breaking these TOS will get you on a public blacklist stating why you're blacklisted.
        <br>> I have every right to deny or cancel a commission at any moment.</p>
      <h4>payment</h4>
      <p>> payment is done in <b>€ [EURO]</b> over PayPal.
        <br>> depending on the project, I either charge <b>100% upfront</b> or <b>50% upfront/50% after finishing.</b>
        <br>> refunds are decided on a case-by-case basis. If you wish to cancel a commission the amount you are refunded depends on how much work has already been done.</p>
      <h4>copyright <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">[CC Licenses]</a></h4> 
        <p><b>Assets</b>
          <br>> assets will be distributed under a CC BY-SA license unless stated otherwise.
          <br>commercial and derivative works are allowed, as long as you're not blatantly reselling the original model.</p>
        <p><b>Characters</b>
          <br>> characters will be distributed under a CC BY-NC-ND license unless stated otherwise.
          <br>> you're still welcome to ask for small changes after the commission is finished and I'll make them free of charge. If you want to make a major edit yourself, please contact me about it.
        </p>
      <h4>references</h4>
        <p>references must be clear and unambiguous. I don't enjoy making changes because of an outdated or confusing reference.
          <br>In case anything should differ from a reference, please clearly state the difference and either provide alternate references or describe it in detail.
